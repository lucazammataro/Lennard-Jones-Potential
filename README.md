## The Lennard-Jones Potential

The Notebook includes a Python code which has been proposed, for the firs time, in a Medium article published in 2020. You can find the article following the link:

The Lennard-Jones (JP) was initially proposed in 1924 by Sir John Edward Lennard-Jones for liquid argon. 
This potential governs the strength of the interaction and repulsion for a pair of atoms i and j located at ri and rj positions. 
It calculates their accelerations and forces based on their distance of separation r.

The LJP addresses the topic of the fundamental molecular dynamics of non-bonded interactions using a soft-disk fluid simulation, which is an implementation of the Equation of Motion in which a spherical particle (atoms) interact with one another. Interactions between pairs of atoms are calculated for providing the two principal features of interatomic forces:

-Repulsive forces: resistance to compression.
-Attractive forces: mutual attraction of pairs of particles over a range of separations (dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, van der Waals forces encompassing London dispersion forces).
